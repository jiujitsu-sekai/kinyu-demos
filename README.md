# Kinyu Demos

This is a place where I put demos of concepts used (or could be used) in financial services / banking that I find interesting.

[IR Risk in Multicurve Env](https://files.tayglobal.com/blog/2020-07-31/IR+Risk+in+Multicurve+Env.html)

For a single swap and a portfolio, show how we could display a risk ladder. The tenors would be based on market data used to build the curves. Two curves are involved in this demo, a projection curve and a funding curve.

[Dependency Graph](https://files.tayglobal.com/blog/Dependency+Graph.html)

Demonstrate the dependency graph heavily used in Goldman Sache (SecDB), JPMorgan (Athena), Bank of America (Quartz) and Beacon.io.
