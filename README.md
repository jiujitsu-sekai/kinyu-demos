# Kinyu Demos

This is a place where I put demos of concepts used (or could be used) in financial services / banking that I find interesting.

## IR Risk in Multicurve-Env

Having sat next to some rates trader and seeing the system they use to understand, hedge or profit from their risk, I often thought it would be fun to build that system. Of course the bank has poured millions of dollar into such system so I will not be making a clone. Instead I want to show (what you already know) how powerful and expressive python can be. With a Jupyter notebook I will show how you could build a poor man’s version.


Not only does it show how little code is required, but it will also show how easy it is in python to visualise your data on each step of the way to your goal. 


I will be using QuantLib for bootstrapping and pricing, Pandas/Matplotlib for visualising tabula and plotting respectively.


Without further ado, let’s get our hands dirty, see the link below:

And if you would like to run the notebook yourself. Here it is.
